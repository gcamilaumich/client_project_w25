            <h2> How to Help</h2>
                    <p> We are so excited you want to help us! Thank you for supporting our mission to ensure that no one goes without at U-M. There are many ways you can help. From making monetary donations to dropping off items like cookware and food to donating your time.</p>

                    <h3> Money </h3>
                        <p> When you donate money to the Maize and Blue Cupboard, your contribution goes ten times further by helping purchase discounted food from a community food bank, making every dollar impactful for students in need. All donations must be made online, and there are four ways to give: the Deborah and Steve Rosenthal Family Fund, which ensures long-term sustainability for food insecurity programs; the Maize and Blue Cupboard Endowment Fund, dedicated to supporting long-term projects and student support; the Maize and Blue Cupboard Fund, which provides immediate assistance by purchasing food and supporting student programming; and the Strong Enough for All Fund, which addresses critical and urgent student needs, offering healthy food and personal items. Each fund plays a vital role in ensuring that students facing hunger can thrive during their time at the University of Michigan.</p>

                    <h3> Goods </h3>
                        <p> Consider donating produce, canned and dry goods, cookware, and personal care items to support students in need. To ensure the health and safety of students, all donations must meet federal, state, and local food safety regulations. Fresh produce should be whole, free from mold or severe bruising, and canned or dry goods must be unopened, in original packaging, and free from dents or rust. Donations should also include a variety of nutritious items such as low-sodium canned vegetables, whole grains like brown rice or quinoa, protein-rich foods like beans and lean meats, low-fat dairy, and shelf-stable healthy fats. Spices, kitchenware (like pots, pans, and utensils), and personal care items (toilet paper, shampoo, and deodorant) are also valuable contributions to help students live more comfortably while focusing on their education. Please ensure items are not expired and are in good condition before donating.</p>
